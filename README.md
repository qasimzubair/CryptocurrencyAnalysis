# Cryptocurrency Data Analysis

## Overview
This Python script facilitates the analysis of cryptocurrency data, including fetching historical price data from the CoinAPI using an API key, cleaning and preprocessing the data, performing statistical analysis, and visualizing the results. It utilizes popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to streamline the analysis process and present insights effectively.

## Features
- **Data Extraction and Cleaning:** Fetches historical price data from the CoinAPI using an API key through web scraping with API requests and cleans the data by handling missing values and outliers.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Calculates mean returns, median returns, standard deviation of returns, and identifies dates with the highest returns for each cryptocurrency.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Generates a correlation matrix to identify relationships between different cryptocurrencies.
- **Data Visualization:** Presents historical price trends and comparative performance using line charts and bar charts.

## How to Use
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib.
3. Obtain an API key from CoinAPI and replace `'DD8C2BE5-C8E6-404E-A289-82A9EBD2D8DC'` with your API key in the script.
4. Define the cryptocurrency symbols you want to analyze and the period ID (e.g., `'1DAY'` for daily data).
5. Run the script, which will fetch, clean, analyze, and visualize the cryptocurrency data automatically.
6. 
# Summary
The analysis provides valuable insights into the performance, volatility, and relationships between Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Ripple (XRP). The generated visualizations aid in understanding market trends and making informed investment decisions in the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape.
